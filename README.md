# sxcndhxnd

A fun little project for me and Nixon to learn web dev foundations (HTML/CSS) and mess around in Next.

Inspired by a talk I had with Nico at Leg Up On Life about adding a shopping cart to his [current website](https://www.sxcndhxnd.com/).

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
